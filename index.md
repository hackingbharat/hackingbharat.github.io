**BECOMING A HACKER**
As you know our blogs are focused on writing only important content in limited time, so we try to write only important tutorials, tips, tricks, tweaks, steps, information, statistics, news, data, info and others which can be useful & important for you. So without diverting mind let’s start.

It is not an easy task to be a hacker. As a hacker, you must have hacker attitude, patience, learning attitude and curiosity. So always ready to learn. As you already know basic info about hacker, i’ll not tell you “a person who find weakness in computer systems or networks, called Hacker”. and i’ll also not told you “there are basic three types of hackers, 1)-white hat, 2)-grey hat & 3)-black hat hacker”. and also i’ll not told you “white hat hacker do right thing and good hacker, grey hat and black hat hacker are bad guys which do or involves in bad and/or illegal works and/or hacks, grey hat & black hat hackers are also known as cyber criminals. So what should you must know & learn to become hacker.

**STEPS TO BECOME A HACKER**
We are covering basic steps which you can follow to become hacker but always remember everything is depends on you because you should focus on it with full determination. so follow these steps and learn everything one by one.

**LEARN HTML**
If you just begin learn hacking now, then you must learn basic HTML (HyperText Mark-Up Language) because HTML is also small part of Hacking.
When hacker try to examine web page of website for vulnerability then they should know basic HTML to understand page source code.
HTML can be written in any basic or advanced text editor, it doesn’t require any specific IDE or software, you can just write your HTML code on any text editor software and save that file with .html extenstion. example- your-file-name.html

**LEARNING UNIX / LINUX**
You should learn to use these OS using CLI and you must have good practice of basic used commands in hacking, scanning etc..  UNIX / Linux is an open source operating system that provides better secure computer systems. It was first developed by AT & T Bell Labs and has contributed a lot to the world of security. You should install the free open source version of LINUX on your desktop because it is impossible to become a hacker without learning UNIX / LINUX. There are many OS in market which can be useful for perform hacking attack or/for learning purpose, hacker mostly used Kali Linux and some hackers prefer ParrotOS for hacking and some prefer arch and many more. I want to tell you one interesting thing which no one will easily tell you, “Choosing an OS is depends on ‘what are you gonna hack’ and ‘what tools you require’ to perform this hacking attack”.

**LEARN NETWORK CONCEPTS**
Networking is most important concept in hacking & I personally recommend my student to learn networking focused fully because i personally experienced many organizations already perform penetration tests on their web application but they forgot to secure their network fully, so this is your plus point. Another important step to becoming a hacker is to be good at network concepts and understand how networks are created. You need to understand the differences between different types of networks. You must have a clear understanding of TCP/IP, UDP and most used (important) ports. Understanding LAN, WAN, VPN, and firewall are also very important. You should give time to learn and focus on learning because you’ll not need to come in future.

**LEARN MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS**
It is vital that hackers learn multiple operating systems. There are many other operating systems besides Windows, UNIX / LINUX, etc., each system has vulnerabilities and hackers need to take advantage of it.

**LEARN CRYPTOGRAPHY**
To be a successful hacker, you must master the art of passwords. Encryption and decryption are important skills for hackers. Encryption is performed extensively on several aspects of identity verification, confidentiality and data integrity information system security. Information on a network is transmitted in encrypted forms, such as passwords. When hacking a system, these encrypted codes need to be decrypted .

**LEARN MORE HACKING TECHNIQUES**
Learn various tutorials and books written by experts in the field of hacking. In the field of hacking, learning is endless, as security updates in the system change daily.

**MULTIPLE PRACTICES**
After learning some concepts, sit back and practice. Set goals for your own practice. You need a good computer system with some tools, and may also need a powerful processor, RAM, etc., constantly testing and learning until you enter the system.

**PROMOTE OPEN SOURCE SECURITY PROJECTS**
An open source computer security project can help you exercise and test your hacking skills. Some organizations such as Mozilla, APACHE provide open source projects. Contributing or being part of it, even if your contribution is small, it will be of great value to improve your field.

**START WRITING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE**
New hackers must start by writing programs that are fun and useful from other hacker’s point of view. And, they must also give away their program sources to the whole hacker community for use.

**ENDLESS LEARNING**
Learning is the key to success in the hacker world. Continuous learning and practice make you the best hacker. Stay tuned for changes in security updates and learn new ways to hack the system.

**PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSIONS AND EXCHANGES**
The most important thing for a hacker is to participate in a community or forum, discuss with other hackers around the world, share their knowledge and work for a team.

**GAIN THE KNOWLEDGE OF PROGRAMMING**
If a person’s ultimate goal is to become a master ethical hacker, then he will be needing more than basic English for writing his masterpiece. Programming languages play an important part in Hacker’s life.
Python is the best language for hacking because it cleanly designed, well documented, relatively kind to beginners, compelling, flexible and well-suited for large projects. It is considered as a good first language in programming.

**LEARN ABOUT MOST DEMANDING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES IN 2020**
For advanced level of programming, the next best alternative language available is Java.
Similar to Python but different from Java is JavaScript as it is a C-based language and completely new-user friendly. Substitute of JavaScript is PHP C, which is a core language for UNIX. If a programmer knows C, then learning C++ will be a cakewalk for him because it is closely related to C.
A smart person is one who starts by using good platforms like Backtrack 5 R3, Kali or Ubuntu 12.04LTS.
Every year most demanding language graph changed and goes up-down depend on their use, like- facebook and google are large organization and before some year they used some programming language in their front-end & back-end system but time to time programming language failed to improved their self and these big organization replaced them with other language. Even facebook and Google like big organization build their own language and thats are currently used for their products and services. Some one says, “Great features come with Great Vulnerability”, so when they replace themself with other language then hackers pentest application, in most case they can find new vulnerability. 
Programming language demands are always depends on their used in IT Industry, so always learn most used and trusted language which survived and improved their self time to time. like- Python, PHP, Perl, Javascript, HTML (html is not programming language because it’s markup language, HTML is not used for programming purpose).

**LEARN MORE THAN ONE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**
When you are trying to become a hacker, it is very important to learn other modern computer programming languages such as Java, Perl, PHP, and Python. One of the best ways to learn these is by reading books from experts. It will also help to know about markup languages like XML, HTML and data formats such as JSON, Protobuf, and others which are a common way to transfer data between client and server.

Java is one of the most popular programming languages. It has been claimed that it’s also very secure. Knowing Java security model will empower you to understand how this language achieves security. Learn about the security loopholes in Java language and related frameworks. Pick and read from many free PDF, tutorials and ebooks available to learn java online.

Perl is a general purpose dynamic programming language, which is a high level and can be interpreted. This language borrows some features of C language. On the other hand, JAVA is concurrent, class-based and objects oriented programming language. Python is really handy when you are trying to automate some repetitive tasks.

HTML is the markup language based on which the web pages are designed, created and displayed. The web browsers read the HTML code to display the web page.

Python is best language for web development and favorite language of a lot of programmers due to its simplicity and quick turn around. A lot of people use Python to do simple and complex automation.

**BE A CREATIVE THINKER**
After learning the basic skills of hacking, an aspiring hacker must start thinking artistically. Established hackers are like engineers, artists and philosophers and brought together inside one person.
True hackers ‘work as intensively as they play and play as intensively as they work.’ For them, the boundaries between “Play”, “Work”, “Science”, and “Art” all tend to disappear or merge into a high-level creative playfulness.
To be hackers must read science fiction and attend science fiction conventions, which serves as an opportunity to meet hackers and proto-hackers.
They can even learn martial arts because the kind of mental discipline required in martial arts is the same as the one required in hacking. Those types of martial arts which emphasize on enhancing mental discipline, relaxed awareness, controlling power, rather than raw strength, athleticism, or physical awareness.

**CHANGE ATTITUDE, THINK LIKE A HACKER**
Attitude is most important part in cyber security world, a hacker mindset, talking style, thinking, way of sharing information & helping others are amazing way to understand between hacker, noob, script kiddies or professional cyber security expert. so Be motivated- Be Hacker.

**MAKE A HABIT OF SOLVING PROBLEMS**
Hackers have a belief that sharing information is a moral responsibility, so whenever anyone solves a problem, they should make the information public to help those who share the same problem.
No hacker is ever obligated to give away all his creative products. But, the hackers who does it are the ones who get the highest respect from their co-hackers.
Reading older pieces, such as the “Jargon File”, “Hacker Manifesto” by The Mentor is recommended.

**ABSORB FIGHT AUTHORITY**
The biggest enemies of a hacker are boredom, drudgery, and authoritarian figures who with the help of censorship and secrecy strangle the freedom of information. Monotony pulls apart a hacker from hacking.
A hacker must learn to embrace hacking as a way of life, which means rejecting the “normal” concepts of work and property and choosing to fight for equality and common knowledge.

**PROMOTE VALUABLE INFORMATION**
Another characteristic of a good hacker is that he must be able to collect and filter useful and interesting information into web pages or documents, such as Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) lists, and make those available to all. Those who maintain technical FAQs are respected at the same level as the open-source authors.

**READ SOME GOOD BOOKS FROM EXPERTS**
You’ll get many best hacking related ebooks online which you can download and read it, don’t worry about money because you can download it free.

**WRITE SOME TUTORIALS ABOUT HACKING AND SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE**
After you finished Reading Some Tutorials About Hacking practice it & try to learn more about that topic from internet, and also don’t miss to search all words on that article or video which you don’t know more or not understand well.

**READ SOME TUTORIALS ABOUT HACKING**
This is the simple and best way to start. Read as many tutorials as possible that are meant for hacking. These articles will give you insight and help you develop the attitude to be a hacker. Some tutorials will initiate you with Nmap, Burpsuite, Metasploit, Nessus and SuperScan, some of the hacking programs or tools that hackers generally use. These tutorials are readily available over the internet; Both text and video tutorials are available for you to answer your question how to be a hacker.

**PARTICIPATE IN HACKING CHALLENGES**
Regular participation in hacking challenges can help you learn more and sharpen your knowledge. There are several companies that organize these challenges in order to check the vulnerability of their software products. The most common hacking challenge includes breaching the security system of the software and taking control of the third party computer systems. Apart from that, there are some websites listed below that regularly offer hacking challenges online.
